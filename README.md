## Insult-Generator
Takes a string of words and randomly generates a Shakespearean insult. This program is excellent to use for Vicious Mockery in Dungeons and Dragons!

### Insult-Generator-TTS
Does the same as the Insult-Generator.py and also uses the pyttsx3 module to say the insult.

### What I learned
* String manipulation without the use of the string library.
* Creating multiple lists from one master string, and sorting them using different indexes.
* Appending lists in an if tree for each element in a list.
* Generating random numbers for selecting the element in a list.
* Exposure to the 'pyttsx3' and 're' modules.

### Going forward
* The 'pyttsx3' quickly enables projects to incorporate speech components and I will definitely use this package again if I need that functionality.
* The 're' module is quite cryptic at first look, but with some more use, I can see it becoming useful for string data manipulation.
