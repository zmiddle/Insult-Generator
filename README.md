## Insult-Generator
Takes string of words and randomly generates a Shakespearean insult. This program is great to use for Vicious Mockery in Dungeons and Dragons!

## Insult-Generator-TTS
Does the same as the Insult-Generator.py and also uses the pyttsx3 module to say the insult.

## What I learned:
* String malipulation without the use of the string library.
* Creating multiple lists from one master string, and sorting them using different indexes.
* Appending lists in an if tree for each element in a list.
* Generating random numbers for selecting the element in a list.
